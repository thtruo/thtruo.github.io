You mad bro? Why continue working?

I've worked on things after work and during weekends. I'll lock myself up in a nice cafe (shout out to Espresso and Caffe Zingaro) and spend all weekend hacking away at personal projects.

Urge to build and make things.

"Smart people build things." 

I want to produce and scratch my creative itches.

Setting up this personal site was also a side project. (Why it took so long)

Part of the reason is to write about what I'm learning. [Diana Campbell](https://medium.com/diana-kimball/write-about-what-you-ve-learned-lately-dc9cb4f18db7#.wal0r3il1)
