Lately I've been reflecting a lot on the core skills of a PM. (note the medium articles about the intersections, skillset, etc). 

The role of PMs vary across teams within a company and depends on the needs of a specific team. If you boil away all the environmental differences, what is the core essence that encapsulates a PM's purpose? And I don't mean writing emails and setting up meetings. ;)

It's all about the user - their needs, jobs, lifestyle, feelings.
