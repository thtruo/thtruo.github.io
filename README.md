# Hello world
Hi there:) This is a Git repository of my personal site at [thomastruongchau.com](http://thomastruongchau.com).

## (Modified) Cactus Theme

This is a modified port of [Cactus](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus)'s default theme for Jekyll.

## How to use it

Simply clone this repository, and then run `jekyll serve` inside the directory.
This theme is fully compliant with GH Pages and their dependencies.
For extra info: [Using Jekyll with Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#keeping-jekyll-up-to-date).
