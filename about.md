<p>Hi, I'm Thomas.</p>

<p>One of my life goals is to build and launch a tech company to help people become total badasses.</p>

<p>I am currently a Product Manager at Microsoft's Experimentation Platform group. I help other teams at Microsoft build better products through experimentation and analysis. Previously, I was an undergraduate at Princeton University studying computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>My intellectual interests include: the interplay between design and the human condition, investments and the power of compounding interest, controlled experimentation, human behavior, habit formation, and the science of motivation.</p>

<p>I'm also the biggest geek in the world! I love superheroes from DC and Marvel to everything in between.
