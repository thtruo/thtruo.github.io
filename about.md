![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

<p>Hi, I'm Thomas.</p>

<p>One of my life goals is to build and launch a tech company to help people become total badasses.</p>

<p>I am currently a Product Manager at Microsoft. I help teams across Microsoft build better products through experimentation and analysis. In my previous life, I was an undergraduate at Princeton University, studying computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction.</p>

<p>My intellectual interests include: the interplay between design and the human condition, investments and the power of compounding interest, controlled experimentation, human behavior, habit formation, and the science of motivation.</p>

<p>I'm also the biggest geek in the world! I love superheroes from DC and Marvel to everything in between. With the MCU and DCEU, it's a great time to be a fan. :)</p>

<p>Always open to talk and meet new folks. Feel free to reach out!</p>
