Hi! I'm Thomas.

One of my life goals is to build and launch a tech company to help people become total badasses.

I am currently a Product Manager at [Microsoft](https://twitter.com/Microsoft). In my previous life, I was an undergraduate at [Princeton University](https://twitter.com/Princeton), studying computer science with a focus on human-computer interaction.

My intellectual interests include: the interplay between design and the human condition, investments and the power of compounding interest, controlled experimentation, human behavior, habit formation, and the science of motivation.
